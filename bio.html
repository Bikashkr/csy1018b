              kind of question used to arise inside me.From there only I get
              determined  about my technological life,i decided to built my
              carrer in  technology. After My schooling i goes for higher school
              studies and i studied computer science there.When i passed out from
              high school, I was in great dilema to choose best college for
              undergraduate study to shape my carrer. I visit to lots of councellors
